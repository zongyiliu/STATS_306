> This data reflects reported criminal offenses that have occurred in the City of Detroit. Offense data was extracted from the Detroit Police Department's records management system. This data set contains the most recent data available and is updated anytime DPD sends official crime records contributing to the Michigan Incident Crime Reporting (MICR) or the National Incident Based Reporting systems (reflected by the IBR Date field). It should be noted that some incidents involve the commission of multiple offenses, such as a domestic assault where property was also vandalized. Accordingly, the data describe all offenses associated with all reported incidents.

## WikiArt Emotions Dataset

[WikiArt Emotions Dataset](http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/wikiartemotions.html), retrieved 2022-10-06.

> WikiArt Emotions is a dataset of 4,105 pieces of art (mostly paintings) that has annotations for emotions evoked in the observer. The pieces of art were selected from WikiArt.org's collection for twenty-two categories (impressionism, realism, etc.) from four western styles (Renaissance Art, Post-Renaissance Art, Modern Art, and Contemporary Art). WikiArt.org shows notable art in each category in a Featured page. We selected ~200 items from the featured page of each category. The art is annotated via crowdsourcing for one or more of twenty emotion categories (including neutral). In addition to emotions, the art is also annotated for whether it includes the depiction of a face and how much the observers like the art. We do not redistribute the art (images), we provide only the annotations.
